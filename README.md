# Boundary Value and Equivalence Partitioning Analysis 
## CED03 (Software Testing) - Practical 1

- Construct a shop class with basic funcitonalities (eg :- buy, sell, restock products)
- Create Boundary Value test cases for all function attributes of class Shop
- Create Equivalence Partitioning test cases for the same

## Code Structure
- Shop class is present at `src/main/java/com.nishant.demo`
- Test cases for all methods of Shop class are made in separate test classes
- Navigate to `src/test/java/com.nishant.demo` to view all test classes
- Test classes ending with **BV** represent Boundary Value test class and **EP** represent Equivalence Partitioning test class
